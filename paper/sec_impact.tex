\section*{Broader Impact}
On the positive side, this paper aims at increasing robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) which we consider as an important goal to ensure positive impact of machine learning on our society. In particular, robustness against bit errors, as discussed in this paper, has the potential to lead to improved energy-efficiency of DNN accelerators due to low-voltage operation. Obviously, improved energy-efficiency while maintaining the same prediction performance is a desirable goal.

On the negative side as we are discussing defenses against adversarial manipulation of the DNN weights on a bit-level we also have to discuss attacks to challenge the defense. Thus, we introduce and discuss bit-level adversarial attacks on the weights which, in principle, could be abused to attack an ``undefended'' model. However, this kind of conflict is unavoidable when discussing security relevant issues of machine learning systems.
